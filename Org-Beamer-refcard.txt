* Org Beamer reference card

Welcome to Org Beamer reference card. It contains the reference documentation
that describes how to *write presentations* using Org Babel 8.

** ox-beamer

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x load-library RET ox-beamer RET
#+end_src

to load the Beamer back-end library

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x org-beamer-mode RET
#+end_src

to load a minor mode easing structure edition of the document.

** Keywords

The =beamer= back-end also introduces the following keywords:

#+begin_src org
#+BEAMER_THEME: Boadilla
#+end_src

is equivalent to:

#+begin_src org
#+BEAMER_COLOR_THEME: dolphin
#+BEAMER_FONT_THEME: default
#+BEAMER_INNER_THEME: [shadow]rounded
#+BEAMER_OUTER_THEME: infolines
#+end_src

#+begin_src org
#+BEAMER_HEADER:
#+end_src

* Environment tags

** againframe

** appendix

You can add an appendix to your talk by using the =\appendix= command. You
should put frames and perhaps whole subsections into the appendix that you do
not intend to show during your presentation, but which might be useful to
answer a question. The =\appendix= command essentially just starts a new part
named =\appendixname=. However, it also sets up certain hyperlinks. Like other
parts, the appendix is kept separate from your actual talk.

** column

** columns

** frame

- Headlines become frames when their level is equal to =org-beamer-frame-level=
  (or =H= value in the =OPTIONS= line).

- Though, if a headline in the current tree has a =BEAMER_env= property set to
  either =frame= or =fullframe=, its level overrides the variable.

** fullframe                                                     :B_fullframe:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: fullframe
   :END:

- A =fullframe= is a =frame= with an ignored title
  + =frametitle= is set to the empty string

** ignoreheading                                             :B_ignoreheading:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
   :END:

- A headline with an =ignoreheading= environment will have its contents only
  inserted in the output.
  + Contents is not inserted in any =frame= environment...

- This special value is useful to have data between frames, or to properly
  close a =column= environment.

    :END:

** =exampleblock= environment

- Inserts a block that is supposed to be an example.
- Behaves like the =block= environment otherwise.

*** Example                                                   :B_exampleblock:
    :PROPERTIES:

** =definition= environment

- Behaves like the =theorem= environment, except that the theorem style
  =definition= is used.

    :END:

** =example= environment

- Behaves like the theorem environment, except that the theorem style =example=
  is used.

  =exampleblock= instead of a =block=.

  not in the first /p/ numbers.\qedhere

** Verbatim

#+begin_src c
int main (void)
{
  std::vector<bool> is_prime (100, true);
  for (int i = 2; i < 100; i++)
    if (is_prime[i])
      {
        std::cout << i << " ";
        for (int j = i; j < 100;
             is_prime [j] = false, j+=i);
      }
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

** Extra environments

For simple environments, use:

#+attr_latex: :options {3}
#+begin_myenvironment
Test of a new
environment
#+end_myenvironment

I think we should changes some environment placeholders:

  + Introduce %r which would stand for the raw headline (without any
    processing)
  + %H and %U would use the raw headline text instead.

The previous definition would become:

  '("textpos1" "w" "\\begin{textblock}%r \\visible %a {" "} \\end{textblock}")

WDYT?

* Overlay/action specification (=BEAMER_act=)

** Overlay/action specification (=act=)

- Or default overlay specification when enclosed within square brackets

* Options for the current frame (=BEAMER_opt=)

** Options for the current frame (=opt=)

- =fragile= option is added automatically

- You might want to put =allowframebreaks=0.9= there
